// Line is one item on the payer's receipt, in the payment entity's own
// vocabulary.
//
// Deliberately not order.Line: shared-go's order package imports payment (for
// the saga's PaymentReader), so payment importing order would close an import
// cycle. The composition root maps between them, exactly as it adapts a provider
// client to Provider — see paymentLinesFromOrder in cmd/api.
//
// Amounts are in the currency's minor unit, like everything else here. Amount is
// the line's total (UnitCount × UnitPrice) rather than something to be recomputed
// downstream, because that is the number a provider's receipt has to reconcile
// against.

// orderTypeOrder is the OrderType stamped on every payment this entity creates.
//
// The field is not redundant on the projection, only on the way in. Historically
// a payment pointed straight at a team and OrderType said which kind
// ("patrulje", "klan", "g\u00f8gler"); 769 of the 1189 rows still look like that, and
// mobilepayCallbackHandler branches on it to recover the payer's identity. Since
// the order entity landed, every new payment is for an order — so the value is a
// constant here and Charge does not ask a caller to repeat it.

// Charge is a request to take money.
//
// A struct rather than a positional list because the previous signature took
// seven arguments of which three were adjacent strings, so a transposition would
// have compiled and silently mis-linked the payment to its order.
//
// Lines are optional and descriptive: they become the receipt the payer sees and
// are recorded on the requested event. They must sum to Amount — see
// linesReconcile — because a receipt that disagrees with the sum charged is
// worse than no receipt.

//
// This is not pedantry. An open order's lines sum to its total while the charge

// paid — and a payment provider may reject, or worse silently accept, a receipt
