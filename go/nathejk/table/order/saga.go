// DefaultSagaSettle is the total budget the saga spends waiting for the
// (eventually consistent) payment projection to reflect a just-received
// payment. It is spread across DefaultSagaAttempts reads rather than paid as a
// single up-front sleep, so an order whose projection is already current
// transitions immediately instead of always waiting the full interval.
const DefaultSagaSettle = 2 * time.Second

// DefaultSagaAttempts is how many times HandleMessage reads the projection
// before giving up on a not-yet-fully-paid order. Tolerates projection lag: a
// genuinely under-paid order simply exhausts the attempts and stays open.

// saga listens for payment events and transitions the corresponding order
// to status="paid" once cumulative payments cover its total. This is the
// only path by which orders reach StatusPaid; once there, the
// SetDerivedLines / AddManualLine / RemoveLine / Cancel commands all
// reject mutations with ErrNotOpen, giving the immutability guarantee
// users asked for.
//
// The saga is idempotent at multiple layers:
//
//   - It only emits NathejkOrderPaid when the order is currently
//     StatusOpen (a paid order returns early).
//   - The projector's handlePaid uses WHERE status='open' so a replayed
//     event is a no-op.
//
// It is *not* perfectly race-free: a partial-refund flow could land an
// order back below its total after status=paid. That isn't on the
// roadmap — flag for revisit if it ever is.
