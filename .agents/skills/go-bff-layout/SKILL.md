  Conventions and directory layout for the Go backend-for-frontend (BFF) used
  across Nathejk repos. Apply this skill when adding HTTP handlers, routes,
  data models, domain tables, jetstream consumers, or wiring new dependencies
  into the `cmd/api` entrypoint of a Go service. Trigger phrases: "add an
  endpoint", "new handler", "new route", "extend the API", "add a model",
  "wire a new table/projection", "add a jetstream consumer", "BFF",
  "backend-for-frontend".

# Go BFF Layout

The backend is a single Go binary (`cmd/api`) that serves both the SPA's JSON
API and the static SPA bundle in production. It speaks to MariaDB for state
and to NATS JetStream for events. It is always developed and run inside the
`api` container — never on the host.

Streaming infra is **not** vendored in this repo. It comes from the external
module `github.com/jrgensen/stream` (subpackages `jetstream`, `xstream`,
`subject`, `metatagger`). Shared domain types and messages come from
`github.com/nathejk/shared-go` (`.../types`, `.../messages`). Import these
directly — do not reintroduce a local `superfluids/` package (it has been
retired in favour of `github.com/jrgensen/stream`).

The `internal` / `pkg` / `nathejk` split is deliberate:

- **`internal/`** — anything specific to *this* binary that is not a domain
  aggregate (transport, infra clients, validators, loggers).
- **`nathejk/`** — the *domain*. Aggregates live as `table` sub-packages, each
  owning its own SQL schema slice and consuming its own subjects.
- **`pkg/`** — genuinely generic Go code with no project-specific knowledge.

If you can't decide, default to `internal/`.

---

## How a request flows

1. `cmd/api/main.go` builds:
   - `*sql.DB` reader and a `sqlpersister` writer
   - JetStream connection (`github.com/jrgensen/stream/jetstream`)
   - One projector per aggregate (`nathejk/table/<x>`)
   - An `xstream.Mux` (`github.com/jrgensen/stream/xstream`) that fans
     subjects to the projectors
   - `data.Models` — read-only facade handed to HTTP handlers
   - `commands.Commands` — write-side facade (publishes events)
   - SMS, mailer, payment clients
2. `routes.go` registers handlers on `httprouter` under `/api/...` and
   `/callback/...`, plus an SPA-fallback `http.FileServer` at `/`.
3. Handlers (`signup.go`, `klan.go`, …) read via `app.models` and write via
   `app.commands`. They never touch SQL or JetStream directly.
4. Commands publish JetStream events. Projectors subscribed via the mux
   update SQL read models. The next read sees the new state.

This is event-sourced-ish: SQL tables are projections, JetStream is the log.

## Conventions

### Adding an endpoint

1. Add the route in `cmd/api/routes.go`, grouped with related routes.
2. Create or extend the resource file (`signup.go`, `klan.go`, …). One handler
   func per route, named `<verb><Resource>Handler`
   (e.g. `createSignupHandler`, `showKlanHandler`).
3. Read through `app.models.<X>`; write through `app.commands.<X>`.
4. Use `app.WriteJSON`, `app.ReadJSON`, `app.ServerErrorResponse`,
   `app.NotFoundResponse`, etc. from `cmd/api/app` — do not write
   `http.Error` or `json.NewEncoder` by hand.
5. **All endpoints must have OpenAPI annotations** (repo rule from `.rules`).

### Adding a domain aggregate

1. Create `go/nathejk/table/<aggregate>/` with at minimum:
   - A `New(js, writer, reader, opts...)` constructor.
   - One or more `Consume(...)` methods registered via `xstream.Mux`.
   - A read API used by `internal/data` to expose to handlers.
2. Wire it in `cmd/api/main.go`:
   - Construct it.
   - Add it to `mux.AddConsumer(...)`.
   - Pass it into `data.NewModels(...)` and/or `commands.New(...)`.

### Adding a command

1. Define the command struct in `internal/commands/` or `nathejk/commands/`
   (domain-specific commands go under `nathejk/`).
2. Publish the resulting event(s) via a `github.com/jrgensen/stream` stream
   (subjects are built with `github.com/jrgensen/stream/subject`).
3. Ensure at least one projector consumes the event so SQL state converges.

### Modules and versions

- Module path: `nathejk.dk` (see `go.mod`). Use that prefix for internal
  imports, e.g. `nathejk.dk/internal/data`.
- Shared code lives in the external module `github.com/nathejk/shared-go`.
  In dev, `go/go.work` resolves it from a sibling `../../shared-go` checkout
  (bind-mounted at `/shared-go` in the `api` container) so edits are picked up
  live. Prod/CI builds run with `GOWORK=off` and resolve the version pinned in
  `go.mod` from the module proxy. Don't commit changes that only build with the
  workspace active.
- Go version follows `go.mod` — do not bump it ad-hoc; bump it as its own
  task. The dev container image (`golang:1.25` in the Dockerfile) must
  match.

### Dev tools (staticcheck, gosec, govulncheck)

Dev tools are managed as **`tool` directives in `go.mod`** (Go 1.24+) and run via
`go tool <name>`, so they are version-pinned in `go.mod`/`go.sum` and always
build with the current toolchain. Add a new one with
`go get -tool <pkg>` (run inside the `api` container). Do **not** `go install`
tools into the image — the `api:/go` volume would shadow the binary and freeze
it at an old Go version.

Registered tools: `honnef.co/go/tools/cmd/staticcheck`,
`github.com/securego/gosec/v2/cmd/gosec`, `golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck`.

### Tests and lint

The dev container re-runs these on every `.go`/`.sql` change (see
`docker/init/api-dev`):

```sh
go test -timeout 10s ./...
go vet ./...            # hard gate
go tool staticcheck ./...   # hard gate
go build ./...
```

If any fail the dev loop will not restart the binary — keep `./...` green.
`gosec` and `govulncheck` also run once at container startup, but **report-only**
(they don't gate the loop, since gosec findings and govulncheck's network vuln-DB
fetch shouldn't block hot reload).

CI does not run a separate `go test` step. The workflow
(`.github/workflows/build-and-publish.yml`) builds the Docker image on every
pull request and push to `main`; the `build` stage runs `go test -timeout 60s
./...` + `go tool staticcheck ./...` before compiling the static binary, so a
red test or lint failure fails the image build.

### Configuration

All configuration is read from environment variables in `cmd/api/main.go` via
`flag.StringVar(..., os.Getenv("..."), ...)`. Never read env vars deeper in
the call tree — pass them down through the `config` struct. Add new vars to
`docker-compose.yml` (with sensible dev defaults) and document them in the
relevant task or PR.

---

## Running things

Always inside containers — see the `docker-dev-stack` skill.

```sh
# rebuild after Dockerfile change
docker compose build api

# tail the API
docker compose logs -f api

# one-off go command
docker compose run --rm api go test ./...
docker compose run --rm --entrypoint go api tool staticcheck ./...
```

The `api` container's entrypoint (`docker/init/api-dev`) already runs
`go test`, `staticcheck`, `go build`, then `go run nathejk.dk/cmd/api`, and
restarts on any `.go`/`.sql` change via `inotifywait`. You normally do not
need to restart the container manually.

---

## Don'ts

- Don't add a second `cmd/<binary>` unless you genuinely need a separate
  process — extra workers belong as JetStream consumers in the same binary.
- Don't bypass `data.Models` / `commands.Commands` from handlers.
- Don't run `go` directly on the host. Always go through `docker compose`.
- Don't import from `cmd/api` into `internal/` or `nathejk/` — dependencies
  flow inward only.
